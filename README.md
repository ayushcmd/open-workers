## About Open Workers

> **Open Workers** is a multi-purpose GitHub automation platform designed to help developers maintain, improve, and organize their repositories through one GitHub App.

Instead of installing dozens of disconnected single-purpose bots, Open Workers provides a unified, least-privilege automation suite built around six core repository disciplines: **Licensing**, **Community Standards**, **Security**, **Documentation**, **PR & Issue Management**, and **Repository Automation**.

### Operational Principles: Inspect &rarr; Recommend &rarr; Act

Open Workers strictly adheres to a three-stage operational model:

```
+------------------+         +----------------------+         +-----------------------+
|  1. INSPECT      |  ====>  |  2. RECOMMEND        |  ====>  |  3. ACT               |
|  Scan repository |         |  Evaluate health &   |         |  Create reviewable    |
|  files & headers |         |  deterministic rules |         |  pull requests (PRs)  |
+------------------+         +----------------------+         +-----------------------+
```

1. **Inspect:** Examine public repository metadata, default branches, root files, and `.github/` trees on demand via the GitHub REST API without retaining repository code or secrets.
2. **Recommend:** Evaluate findings against transparent, deterministic policy engines and industry standards, providing clear health scores and plain-language recommendations.
3. **Act:** Propose authorized, verified changes through reviewable Pull Requests on isolated feature branches (`chore/*`). The repository default branch is never modified directly.

---

## Six Core Capabilities

Open Workers is architected around six modular capability areas, all fully implemented and available in production:

```
                  +-----------------------------------------+
                  |               OPEN WORKERS              |
                  |   One GitHub App. Multiple Capabilities |
                  +-----------------------------------------+
                                       |
       +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
       |                                                               |

```

### 1. Licensing &mdash; Available

A complete open-source licensing toolkit designed to remove legal ambiguity and enforce repository attribution:

- **SPDX License Explorer:** Curated catalog of 12 OSI-approved and FSF-libre licenses (`MIT`, `Apache-2.0`, `GPL-3.0-only`, `AGPL-3.0-only`, `BSD-2-Clause`, `BSD-3-Clause`, `ISC`, `LGPL-3.0-only`, `MPL-2.0`, `EPL-2.0`, `The Unlicense`, `CC0-1.0`) with permissions, conditions, and limitations breakdown.
- **Deterministic Policy Questionnaire:** 4-question policy evaluation (commercial use, patent grants, copyleft boundaries, network triggers) providing ranked recommendations independent of programming language.
- **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Compare up to 4 licenses simultaneously with customizable copyright year and holder parameters.
- **License Compatibility Matrix:** Dependency license audit identifying copyleft conflicts (e.g., Apache-2.0 dependency compatibility with GPL-2.0 vs GPL-3.0).

## Unified Repository Dashboard

The **Unified Repository Dashboard** connects all six core platform capabilities into a single coherent inspection:

$$\textbf{One Repository} \longrightarrow \textbf{Six Capabilities} \longrightarrow \textbf{One Actionable Report}$$

Instead of jumping between disconnected tools, developers can enter a repository specifier (`owner/repo` or GitHub URL) once to receive an aggregated assessment:

- **Cross-Module Health Overview:** Parallel execution of Licensing, Community, Security, Documentation, PR & Issues, and Automation audits using bounded concurrency with strict per-module error isolation (`Promise.allSettled`).
- **Prioritized Action Items:** Findings from all modules are normalized, ranked by impact (High, Medium, Low), and presented with one-click fix buttons that link directly to the relevant tool with the repository pre-filled.
- **Privacy & Authorization Guard:** Public repositories can be audited immediately. Private repositories require user authorization (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`) and verify collaborator read/write access in memory across all module audit endpoints before exposing findings.
- **Stateless & Database-Free:** Zero repository code, tokens, or audit records are cached or stored on disk.

## How It Works

<div align="center">
  <img src="./public/assets/workflow.svg" alt="Open Workers Platform Architecture & Workflow" width="100%">
</div>

1. **Connect or Browse:** Open [open-workers.onrender.com](https://open-workers.onrender.com) or call the public REST API.
2. **Select Capability:** Choose a task across Licensing or Community standards.
3. **Inspect Repository:** Enter a public or installed repository (`owner/repo`) to inspect default-branch files and health scores.
4. **Customize & Preview:** Review generated Markdown and issue forms directly in the browser; check conflict status for files that already exist on the default branch.
5. **Caller Authorization:** When requesting repository modification, provide a GitHub Personal Access Token (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). Open Workers verifies in-memory that the authenticated user holds write permissions on the target repository.
6. **Isolated Mutation:** The GitHub App client (`@octokit/app`) creates an isolated feature branch (`chore/*`), commits verified files, and opens a transparent Pull Request.
7. **Merge on GitHub:** Maintainers review the Pull Request on GitHub and merge at their own discretion.

---

## Technology Stack

Open Workers is intentionally built with a clean, standard, database-free architecture:

- **Runtime:** Node.js `>=20.0.0` (developed and tested on Node.js v24 LTS)
- **HTTP Server:** Express.js 5 with Helmet security headers and strict CSP
- **JavaScript Standard:** Modern ES6 Modules (`import`/`export`)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and ES6 JavaScript (Primer-inspired, responsive, zero frontend framework overhead)
- **GitHub API Integration:** `@octokit/rest`, `@octokit/app`, and `@octokit/webhooks`
- **Authentication:** In-memory user token verification + GitHub App installation tokens
- **Testing:** Native Node.js `node:test` runner and strict assertions (`node:assert/strict`)
- **Hosting:** Render Cloud Platform
- **Storage:** **Stateless (Zero Database)** &mdash; Tokens and customer source code are never stored.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js `>=20.0.0`** (Node.js v24 LTS recommended)
- **npm** (included with Node.js)
- **Git**

### Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ayushcmd/open-workers.git
cd open-workers

# 2. Install dependencies cleanly
npm ci

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Run tests and syntax verification
npm test
npm run lint:syntax

# 5. Start development server with file watching
npm run dev
```

Visit **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.

> **Note:** Open Workers degrades gracefully when GitHub App keys are omitted in `.env`. All web pages, license exploration, recommendation questionnaires, comparison tools, community document generation, issue/PR template builders, and public repository analysis work immediately without credentials. Automated Pull Request creation activates once GitHub App credentials are provided.

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` &mdash; Run the production server (`node src/server.js`)
- `npm run dev` &mdash; Run with Node's native file-watch mode (`node --watch src/server.js`)
- `npm test` &mdash; Execute the native `node:test` suite (`77 tests`, zero dependencies)
- `npm run lint:syntax` &mdash; Verify syntax across all JavaScript files with `node --check`

---

## GitHub App Integration

Open Workers operates as a least-privilege GitHub App (`open-workers[bot]`, with backward-compatibility recognition for `open-license-advisor[bot]`).

### Scoped Permissions

Open Workers requires only the minimum repository permissions necessary to inspect files and open reviewable pull requests:

| Permission | Scope | Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Repository Contents** | `write` | Required to commit license and community files to dedicated feature branches. |
| **Pull Requests** | `write` | Required to open and manage Pull Requests against the repository default branch. |
| **Repository Metadata** | `read` | Automatically granted by GitHub to read public repository configuration. |

### Two-Layer Security Model

1. **User Identity Verification:** When invoking PR endpoints (`POST /api/trigger-pr` or `POST /api/community/trigger-pr`), callers supply a GitHub Personal Access Token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
2. **Permission Check:** The server verifies that the caller possesses `admin`, `maintain`, or `write` collaborator permissions on the target repository.
3. **App Execution:** The GitHub App installation client acquires a short-lived token to perform mutations on dedicated `chore/*` branches.
4. **Safety Conflict Guards:** Operations fail closed with `HTTP 409 Conflict` if target files already exist, requiring explicit `replaceExisting: true` opt-in.

## Security & Privacy

Open Workers is designed from the ground up with a privacy-preserving, zero-retention posture:

- **Zero Code Persistence:** Open Workers does not operate a database and never caches, stores, or analyzes customer source code beyond requested configuration files (`LICENSE`, community standards).
- **Stateless Authentication:** User tokens provided for PR authorization are held only in volatile process memory for the duration of the request and are never written to disk or logs.
- **HMAC SHA-256 Webhooks:** All incoming GitHub webhooks are cryptographically validated against `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` before processing.
- **Reviewable Mutations:** Open Workers never modifies default branches directly. Every action is delivered as an atomic commit on an isolated feature branch (`chore/*`) for maintainer review.
- **Vulnerability Disclosure:** Please report security issues privately to [ayush_24a12res897@iitp.ac.in](mailto:ayush_24a12res897@iitp.ac.in). Review our full [Security Policy](./docs/SECURITY.md) for details.
