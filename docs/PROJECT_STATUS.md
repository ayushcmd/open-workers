## 1. Executive Summary

**Open Workers** is a multi-purpose GitHub automation platform and least-privilege GitHub App engineered to help developers maintain, improve, and govern repositories across six core capabilities.

The platform operates on a three-stage principle: **Inspect → Recommend → Act**. Repositories are inspected on demand without persisting code or credentials; deterministic guidance is generated; and verified changes are submitted as isolated, reviewable Pull Requests (`chore/*`) on dedicated feature branches.

Following the repository rename from `license-advisor` to `open-workers` and completion of Phase 3, the official Open Workers visual identity has been implemented across the application, website, and documentation.

### 5. PR & Issue Management — Status: Available
- **Deterministic Issue Categorization:** Evaluates issue title and body against keyword dictionaries for 8 categories (`bug`, `feature`, `documentation`, `question`, `enhancement`, `performance`, `maintenance`, `security`) with transparent score breakdowns and confidential security vulnerability reporting guidance (`src/modules/issues/engine.js`, `POST /api/issues/analyze`).
- **Rule-Based Issue Labeling:** Non-destructive label preview (`POST /api/issues/preview-labels`) and mutation (`POST /api/issues/apply-labels`) with color consistency, caller in-memory write authorization, and diagnostic error handling for `issues: write` GitHub App permission requirements.

### 6. Repository Automation — Status: Available
- **Repository Setup & Metadata Audit:** Non-destructive remote audit of CI workflows, code quality configurations (.editorconfig, Prettier, ESLint, .gitattributes, .gitignore), and discovery metadata with transparent 0–100% health scoring (`src/modules/automation/engine.js`, `POST /api/automation/analyze`).
- **Tailored CI Workflow Generators:** Generates verified, valid YAML workflows for Node.js CI, Python CI, Multi-Platform Matrix CI, PR Validation, and Scheduled Maintenance using official actions (v4/v5), minimal token permissions (`contents: read`), explicit timeouts (`timeout-minutes: 15-20`), bounded matrices, and injection defenses (`POST /api/automation/generate`).
- **Workflow Health Inspector:** Analyzes existing `.github/workflows/*.yml` files for unpinned third-party actions, deprecated action references, missing explicit permissions, broad `write-all` permissions, missing timeouts, and dangerous `pull_request_target` triggers (`POST /api/automation/inspect-workflows`).

- **Consolidated Automation Pull Requests:** Multi-file pre-commit preview (`POST /api/automation/preview-pr`) and automated PR creation on dedicated `ci/*` or `chore/*` branches (`POST /api/automation/trigger-pr`) with in-memory caller write PAT verification and strict enforcement of the GitHub App's `workflows: write` permission boundary.

### 7. Unified Repository Dashboard — Status: Available (Orchestration Layer)
- **Single-Entry Repository Health Audit:** One unified entry point allowing maintainers to inspect any repository once and receive an actionable health overview spanning Licensing, Community Standards, Security Policies, Documentation Quality, PR & Issue Health, and Repository Automation (`public/dashboard.html`, `POST /api/dashboard/analyze`).
- **Bounded Concurrency with Error Isolation:** Parallel audit execution orchestrated via `Promise.allSettled` in `src/core/dashboard/coordinator.js`, guaranteeing that an isolated failure or rate limit in one capability does not break the overall dashboard evaluation.
- **Cross-Module Findings Normalization & Priority Ranking:** All module findings are normalized into uniform structured objects, ranked by impact (High, Medium, Low), and surfaced with direct deep-links (`?repo=owner%2Frepo`) to specialized modules for instant remediation (`src/core/dashboard/findings.js`).
- **Status Separation & Evaluation Accuracy:** Distinct `executionStatus` (`completed`, `partial`, `failed`, `not_supported`) and `healthStatus` (`healthy`, `needs_attention`, `critical`, `unknown`), dynamic evaluation counters reflecting real module completion states, and synchronized stale issue inspection passing `staleCount`, `scannedIssues`, and `has_issues` status.
- **Private Repository Privacy Guard:** Rejects unauthenticated inspections of private repositories with `HTTP 401 AUTH_REQUIRED` and verifies caller collaborator access (`HTTP 403 FORBIDDEN`) across all module audit endpoints before exposing any metadata or findings.
- **Top Navigation Architecture:** "Check Repository" retired from primary top navigation across all 14 HTML pages in favor of the Unified Dashboard, while preserving deep license auditing under the Licensing dropdown.
- **Stateless Zero-Persistence Execution:** Preserves Open Workers' core design constraint by caching and persisting zero tokens, source code, or audit findings.
- **Request-Scoped API Efficiency & Concurrency:** Employs `AnalysisContext` (`src/core/github/context.js`) to deduplicate upstream GitHub REST API calls across parallel audits, cutting public repository inspection calls from 35 to 13 (62.9% reduction) and private inspections from 56 to 16 (71.4% reduction), with primary/secondary rate-limit detection in `src/core/github/errors.js`.

## 5. Verification & Quality Control

- **Test Suite:** Built-in Node.js runner (`node:test`) and strict assertions (`node:assert/strict`). Zero external test runner dependencies.
- **Test Results:** **243 passing tests** across 47 test suites with **0 failures**.
- **Syntax Check:** `npm run lint:syntax` validates all 57 ES module JavaScript files using `node --check`.
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Repeatable benchmarks in `tests/perf.test.js` verify bounded concurrency (<= 6 peak operations), request-scoped tree memoization, and rate-limit diagnostics.
